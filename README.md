## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This repository covers my progression through C# programming concepts, from basic syntax to advanced applications and data structures.

## 📖 Topics Covered

### C# Basics
- **Variables and Data Types**: Understanding different data types in C#
- **Control Structures**: 
  - Conditional statements (if/else, switch)
  - Loops (for, foreach, while)
  - Ternary operators
- **Arrays and Collections**: Working with arrays and basic collection types
- **Random Number Generation**: Using the Random class for games and simulations
- **String Manipulation**: String methods, comparison, and formatting
- **Mathematical Operations**: Using Math class methods

### Console Applications
- **Interactive Console Programs**: Building user-friendly console interfaces
- **Calculator Application**: Arithmetic operations with user input
- **To-Do List Application**: 
  - Adding, removing, and viewing tasks
  - Using Lists for dynamic data storage
  - Menu-driven interface design
- **Contact Management System**:
  - Using Dictionaries for key-value storage
  - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  - Input validation and error handling
- **Exception Handling**: Try-catch blocks for robust applications

### Data Structures & Algorithms
- **Arrays**: Implementation and manipulation
- *More topics to be added as learning progresses*

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET SDK (version 6.0 or higher recommended)
- A code editor (Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or any text editor)
- Basic understanding of programming concepts

### Running the Code
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd C#_Learning
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific project folder
3. Create a new console application or copy code snippets into your IDE
4. Run using:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## 💡 Key Projects

### 1. Dice Rolling Game
A simple game that demonstrates random number generation and conditional logic.

### 2. To-Do List Application
A console-based task management system featuring:
- Add new tasks
- Remove existing tasks
- View all tasks
- Clean, menu-driven interface

### 3. Contact Management System
A dictionary-based contact storage system with:
- Add contacts with names and phone numbers
- Remove contacts
- View all contacts
- Input validation

### 4. Calculator Application
A basic arithmetic calculator supporting:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Switch-case structure for operation selection
